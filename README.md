### Summary 
It is well known that greenhouse gases are important for maintaining Earth’s habitability (ability to maintain liquid water on its surface). Recently Lacis et al. (2010) demonstrated, using global climate model experiments, that carbon dioxide, a noncondensing greenhouse gas, is the primary greenhouse gas that controls Earth’s surface temperature and hence its habitability. However, it is still unknown whether habitability can be maintained without condensing greenhouse gases, i.e. water vapor. The goal of this project is to quantify the impact of condensing versus noncondensing greenhouse gases using a global climate model in aqua planet conditions where there are no land processes and no ocean heat transport. We performed two perturbation experiments where we first zeroed out noncondensing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and ozone in order to reproduce Lacis et al’s results using our model. Second, we zeroed out water vapor, a condensing greenhouse gas, by controlling surface evaporation. In both experiments, the surface temperature evolution was quantified to understand the maintenance of Earth’s habitability. Additionally, we have investigated the response to decreasing the ocean mixed layer depth to only 50m. As a result, we found out that when we zero out the noncondensing greenhouse gases, we reach a snowball Earth in 155 years. However, when we zero out water vapor, we still maintain temperatures above freezing in the tropics.

Time evolution of global surface temperature, TOA net flux, column water vapor, planetary albedo, sea ice cover, and cloud cover, after zeroing out non condensing greenhouse gases. The model used in this experiment is the GFDL AM2 (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, Princeton, NJ, affiliated with NOAA and Princeton University). The ice albedo for this experiment was considered to be .65 with a mixed layer depth of 250m. MATLAB code can be accessed through https://github.com/myoussef660/Geophysics
